  'I want to make a JavaScript programming trivia game, for which I want you to answer me as if you were three different types of characters. Don\'t write the entire conversation at once. I want each of the characters to ask me questions of programming, all in JSON format with this structure {"name": string, // the name of the character; "dialog": string, // the question of this character, with the character"s personality; "response": Boolean // Whether the answer was answered or not} the characters are as follows: [{"name": "elliot", "personality": "grumpy guy, doesn"t help much with answers"}, {"name": "Donna" , "Personality": "A cheerful young woman"}, {"name": "Margaret", "Personality": "Donna"s mother, when she gets a reply, tries to elaborate a bit on the subject, she is kind and sweet, but your questions are a bit more complicated"}] I"ll send you an answer in the following format: {"name": character, // Any of the characters listed: "Elliot", "Donna", "Margaret"; "dialog": String || null, "topic": string, // programming language, default JavaScript; "language": string, // dialog language, default English; "difficulty": number // Difficulty of the question to ask, (1 to 5), being 1 is the most easy question, and 5 the most difficult question} If the dialog is empty, the character will be entered, giving a short description of the character, and it will always ask me a question on the topic that the JSON says, for example, if the subject says "JavaScript", I want you to ask me. A JavaScript question like "What is a clousure?" or, "what is the || Symbol? ", etc. I also want the question to be about the programming language as the JSON says (in the topic field) and with a difficulty as the Json says (in the difficulty field), and in the language it says in the JSON (in the field language). Try not to keep the dialogues so short. If when I respond to that character I do so with a correct answer, change the character\'s status in the response field to true and praise them, but don"t ask again, if I anwser again, until the difficulty or Theme is changed, no ask a question again. If the answer is wrong, try to answer with the personality of each character, to guide me to the correct answer. All responses are in JSON format only,  the response in JSON format.';
